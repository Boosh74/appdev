List of Content
	1. Configuration Instructions
		Required:
			-Raspberry Pi
			-Internet Connection
			-USB sound card
			-Microphone
	2. Installation Instructions
		1) Upload the code from the link to your Raspberry: https://github.com/Boosh74/appdev
		2) Connect your Raspberry to Internet
		3) Connect Sound Card and Microphone Recommended to use: C-media Electronics Audio Adapter 
		4) Set USB Sound Card as a deafault sound device with the algorythm below:
			4.1)Use “sudo nano /etc/asound.conf” command and put following content to the file:
					pcm.!default {
					  type plug
					  slave {
						  pcm "hw:1,0"
					  }
					}
					ctl.!default {
				    type hw
				    card 1
					}
			4.2)Go to your home directory. Use “nano .asoundrc” command and put the same content to the file;
			4.3)Run “alsamixer” you should be able to see that USB sound card is the default audio device;
					For a more sensitive sound detection, it is better to maximize the volume of “Mic”;
		5) Install libcurl libtuary;
			5.1)First use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed;
			5.2)If the folder doesn’t exist. Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list;
			5.3)Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3;
			5.4)Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4;


	3. Operating Instructions;
		3.1. Use "make" command to compile program and build the project;
		3.2. If you want to record the sound, write it to file "testcurl.txt" and see the graph representetion of your recording, use "./sound.out";
			3.2.1 To shut down the program use key combination Ctrl+C;
		3.3. If you want to output mono/stereo signal with any particular frequency and duration, use "./sound.out arg" and give necessary values
